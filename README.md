# Test Data Factory

A re-implementation of the API [fishery](https://github.com/thoughtbot/fishery) provides to replace it as a dependency
in a relevant project, after some breaking changes and thus the inability to update it.

The functionality of the library is limited, so it is a good candidate for [vendoring](https://macwright.com/2021/03/11/vendor-by-default.html).
